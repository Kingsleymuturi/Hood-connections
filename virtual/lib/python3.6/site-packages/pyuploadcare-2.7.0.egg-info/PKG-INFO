        Simple file uploads for the web are of most importance
        for us at `Uploadcare`_. Today, everyone is used to the routine of
        allowing users to upload their pics or attach resumes. The routine
        covers it all: installing image processing libraries, adjusting permissions,
        ensuring servers never go down, and enabling CDN.
        Features like uploading from Facebook or manual crop are weighty,
        hence rare.
        Our goal is to change the status quo.
        
        This library consists of the `Uploadcare`_ API interface and a couple
        of Django goodies. You might also want to check out this `guide`_ as
        a starting point.
        
        Simple as that, Uploadcare ``ImageField`` can be added to an
        existing Django project in just a couple of `simple steps`_.
        This will enable your users to see the upload progress, pick files
        from Google Drive or Instagram, and edit a form while files are
        being uploaded asynchronously.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from django import forms
            from django.db import models
        
            from pyuploadcare.dj.models import ImageField
            from pyuploadcare.dj.forms import FileWidget
        
        
            class Candidate(models.Model):
                photo = ImageField(blank=True, manual_crop="")
        
        
            # optional. provide advanced widget options: https://uploadcare.com/docs/uploads/widget/config/#options
            class CandidateForm(forms.Form):
                photo = ImageField(widget=FileWidget(attrs={
                    'data-cdn-base': 'https://cdn.super-candidates.com',
                    'data-image-shrink': '1024x1024',
                }))

        Features
        --------
        
        - Python wrapper for Uploadcare `REST`_ and `Upload`_ APIs.
        - Django widget with useful manual crop and multi-upload.
        - *ucare* console utility.
        - hosted assets (Kudos to `Sławek Ehlert`_!).
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        ``pyuploadcare`` requires Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8.
        
        If you're using ``pyuploadcare`` with Django, check ``.travis.yml`` for supported
        Python-Django combinations.
        
        Obsolete versions of Python and Django are officially not supported, but chances
        are everything still works. If you have to use those, modify tox.ini, test and
        run at your own risk ;) Or, you may use older versions of the library.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        In order to install ``pyuploadcare``, simply run:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install pyuploadcare
        
        or, if you prefer it the old way:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ easy_install pyuploadcare
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        Besides the `Travis CI`_ we use tox. In order to run tests just:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install tox
            $ tox
        
        Security issues
        ---------------
        
        If you think you ran into something in Uploadcare libraries which might have
        security implications, please hit us up at `bugbounty@uploadcare.com`_
        or Hackerone.
        
        We'll contact you personally in a short time to fix an issue through co-op and
        prior to any public disclosure.
        
        Feedback

        Issues and PRs are welcome. You can provide your feedback or drop us a support
        request at `hello@uploadcare.com`_.

        ~~~~~
        
        ``https://ucarecdn.com/`` URL was returned to serve widget's assets.
        
        
        1.2
        ~~~
        
        - CDN URL has been changed to ``http://www.ucarecdn.com/``. Previous URL
          ``https://ucarecdn.com/`` is depricated.
        - Widget was updated up to *0.10.1*.
        
        1.1
        ~~~
        
        - Widget was updated up to *0.10*.
        - Default API version was updated up to *0.3*.
        - Django settings were merged into UPLOADCARE dictionary.
        - Performance was improved by reusing requests' session.
        
        1.0.2
        ~~~~~
        
        ``UnicodeDecodeError`` was fixed. This bug appears when
        `request <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/>`_'s ``method``
        param is unicode and ``requests.request()`` got ``files`` argument, e.g.:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> requests.request(u'post', u'http://httpbin.org/post',
            ...                  files={u'file': open('README.rst', 'rb')})
            UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc5 ...
        
        1.0.1
        ~~~~~
        
        - Widget was updated up to *0.8.1.2*.
        - It was invoking ``File.store()``, ``FileGroup.store()`` methods on every
          model instance saving, e.g.:
        
          .. code-block:: python
        
              photo.title = 'new title'
              photo.save()
        
          Now it happens while saving by form, namely by calling
          ``your_model_form.is_valid()``. There is other thing that can trigger
          storing -- calling ``photo.full_clean()`` directly.
        
        1.0
        ~~~
        
        - Python 3.2, 3.3 support were added.

        ~~~~
        
        - Widget was updated up to *0.6.9.1*.
        
        0.17
        ~~~~
        
        - ``ImageField`` was added. It provides uploading only image files. Moreover,
          you can activate manual crop, e.g. ``ImageField(manual_crop='2:3')``.
        - More appropriate exceptions were added.
        - Tests were separated from library and were restructured.
        - Widget was updated up to *0.6.7*.
        - Issue of ``FileField``'s ``blank``, ``null`` attributes was fixed.

        ~~~~
